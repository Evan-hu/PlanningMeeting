题目二：
You are planning a big programming conference and have received many proposals which have passed the initial screen process but you're having trouble fitting them into the time constraints of the day -- there are so many possibilities! So you write a program to do it for you.
The conference has multiple tracks each of which has a morning and afternoon session.
Each session contains multiple talks.
Morning sessions begin at 9am and must finish before 12 noon, for lunch.
Afternoon sessions begin at 1pm and must finish in time for the networking event.
The networking event can start no earlier than 4:00 and no later than 5:00.
No talk title has numbers in it.
All talk lengths are either in minutes (not hours) or lightning (5 minutes).
Presenters will be very punctual; there needs to be no gap between sessions.

题目二：
你正在计划一个大规划会议和得到许多建议都通过初始屏幕流程但是你难以拟合到一天的时间限制——有太多的可能性!所以你编写一个程序,为你做这些。
	限制条件：每一个会议都有多个
	每一会议包含多个talks
	早间会议9 点开始 必须在12 点结束 吃午饭
	下午会议 13点 开始 在network 开始之前结束、
	network 不早于 16点 不晚于 17 点
	每个会议名中不包含数字
	每个会议只能以分钟（不能是小时）或者lightning（表示五分钟）
	每个会议的主持都很准时，两个会议间不能有间隙

题目三：http://www.ziliao1.com/Article/Show/66DBA2ADEE32D44F09924F515AAA6E6B.html
我成了地球首富，然后有很多钱，但是地球已经不适合人类居住了，需要跑到银河系去做生意，但是银河系使用的是罗马字母表示钱，所以座位程序员的我打算自己写一个罗马字母和十进制数字互转的小程序，以帮助我做生意。

罗马字母有: I，V，X，L，C，D，M

1. I：可以表示十进制数字1，V：可以表示十进制数字5，X：可以表示十进制数字10，L：可以表示十进制数字50，C：可以表示十进制数字100，D：可以表示十进制数字500，M：可以表示十进制数字1000；

2.I, X, C, and M可以重复出现最多3次；

3.一般是从后往前排列：即MDCLXVI的顺序，当然也允许相邻的两个倒序，但是需要符合以下规则:

   I ：只能组合IV ,IX

   X：只能组合XL，XC

   C：只能组合CD，CM

   V，L，D不能倒序
   比如1903 转换 后是 1 9 0 3 = M CM III

   Test input:
	glob is I
	prok is V
	pish is X
	tegj is L
	glob glob Silver is 34 Credits
	glob prok Gold is 57800 Credits
	pish pish Iron is 3910 Credits
	how much is pish tegj glob glob ?
	how many Credits is glob prok Silver ?
	how many Credits is glob prok Gold ?
	how many Credits is glob prok Iron ?
	how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood ?
	
	Test Output:
	pish tegj glob glob is 42
	glob prok Silver is 68 Credits
	glob prok Gold is 57800 Credits
	glob prok Iron is 782 Credits
	I have no idea what you are talking about
